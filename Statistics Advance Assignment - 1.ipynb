    "### Q1. What is the Probability Density Function?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Probability Density Function (PDF)** is a function that describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a particular value. The PDF provides the relative likelihood for the random variable to occur at any point in the continuous range. The total area under the PDF curve is equal to 1, representing the total probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Properties:\n",
    "1. **Non-negativity:** \\( f(x) \\geq 0 \\) for all \\( x \\).\n",
    "2. **Total Area:** The integral of \\( f(x) \\) over the entire range is 1.\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\, dx = 1\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "3. **Probability Calculation:** The probability that the random variable \\( X \\) lies within a certain interval \\([a, b]\\) is given by the integral of the PDF over that interval.\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(a \\leq X \\leq b) = \\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "For a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), the PDF is:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right)^2}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. What Are the Types of Probability Distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability distributions can be broadly classified into two main categories: **Discrete Probability Distributions** and **Continuous Probability Distributions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discrete Probability Distributions:\n",
    "These distributions describe the probability of outcomes of a discrete random variable, which can take on a countable number of distinct values.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Binomial Distribution:**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials (yes/no experiments).\n",
    "   - **Example:** The number of heads in 10 coin flips.\n",
    "   - **Parameters:** Number of trials \\( n \\) and probability of success \\( p \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Poisson Distribution:**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Describes the number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space, given a constant mean rate of occurrence.\n",
    "   - **Example:** The number of emails received in an hour.\n",
    "   - **Parameter:** Mean rate of occurrence \\( \\lambda \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Geometric Distribution:**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Describes the number of trials required for the first success in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "   - **Example:** The number of coin flips until the first head appears.\n",
    "   - **Parameter:** Probability of success \\( p \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Continuous Probability Distributions:\n",
    "These distributions describe the probability of outcomes of a continuous random variable, which can take on any value within a given range.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Normal Distribution:**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Also known as the Gaussian distribution, it describes data that clusters around a mean or average. It is symmetric and bell-shaped.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Heights of people, IQ scores.\n",
    "   - **Parameters:** Mean \\( \\mu \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exponential Distribution:**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Describes the time between events in a Poisson process, where events occur continuously and independently at a constant rate.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Time until the next earthquake.\n",
    "   - **Parameter:** Rate parameter \\( \\lambda \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Uniform Distribution:**\n",
    "   - **Description:** All outcomes are equally likely within a given range.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Rolling a fair die.\n",
    "   - **Parameters:** Lower bound \\( a \\) and upper bound \\( b \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Beta Distribution:**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Describes a distribution of probabilities, often used in Bayesian statistics.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Modeling the probability of success in a binomial distribution.\n",
    "   - **Parameters:** Shape parameters \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Gamma Distribution:**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Generalizes the exponential distribution to model the waiting time for \\( k \\) events to occur.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Waiting time for multiple Poisson events.\n",
    "   - **Parameters:** Shape parameter \\( k \\) and rate parameter \\( \\theta \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these distributions and their properties is fundamental in statistical analysis, allowing for the modeling of different types of data and phenomena."

    "### Q7. How Is the Binomial Distribution Different from the Poisson Distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Binomial Distribution:\n",
    "1. **Definition:** Describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials (each with the same probability of success).\n",
    "2. **Parameters:**\n",
    "   - \\( n \\): Number of trials\n",
    "   - \\( p \\): Probability of success on each trial\n",
    "3. **Characteristics:**\n",
    "   - The number of trials \\( n \\) is fixed.\n",
    "   - Each trial is independent.\n",
    "   - Each trial has only two possible outcomes: success or failure.\n",
    "4. **Example:** The number of heads in 10 flips of a fair coin.\n",
    "5. **Formula:** \n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   where \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) is the binomial coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Poisson Distribution:\n",
    "1. **Definition:** Describes the number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space, given a constant mean rate of occurrence.\n",
    "2. **Parameters:**\n",
    "   - \\( \\lambda \\): Mean number of occurrences in the interval\n",
    "3. **Characteristics:**\n",
    "   - The number of events is countable in an infinite sample space.\n",
    "   - Events occur independently.\n",
    "   - The average rate (events per unit of time or space) is constant.\n",
    "4. **Example:** The number of emails received in an hour.\n",
    "5. **Formula:**\n",

    "### Q8. Generate a Random Sample of Size 1000 from a Poisson Distribution with Mean 5 and Calculate the Sample Mean and Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use Python's `numpy` library to generate the sample and calculate the mean and variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate random sample\n",
    "poisson_sample = np.random.poisson(lam=5, size=1000)\n",

    "# Calculate sample mean and variance\n",

    "sample_variance = np.var(poisson_sample)\n",

    "sample_mean, sample_variance\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q9. How Are Mean and Variance Related in Binomial Distribution and Poisson Distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Binomial Distribution:\n",
    "- **Mean:** \\( \\mu = np \\)\n",
    "- **Variance:** \\( \\sigma^2 = np(1-p) \\)\n",
    "  - Here, \\( n \\) is the number of trials and \\( p \\) is the probability of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Poisson Distribution:\n",
    "- **Mean:** \\( \\mu = \\lambda \\)\n",
    "- **Variance:** \\( \\sigma^2 = \\lambda \\)\n",
    "  - Here, \\( \\lambda \\) is the average rate of occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Poisson distribution, the mean and variance are equal, while in the Binomial distribution, the variance depends on both the number of trials and the probability of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q10. In a Normal Distribution, Where Does the Least Frequent Data Appear with Respect to the Mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a normal distribution, the least frequent data appears in the tails of the distribution. Specifically, the further away from the mean a data point is, the less frequent it is. This is because the normal distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped, with the highest frequency of data points clustered around the mean. The tails of the distribution, which extend towards positive and negative infinity, contain the least frequent data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean, median, and mode of a normal distribution are all located at the center of the distribution, and the frequency of data points decreases as you move away from the mean in either direction."
