If you inadvertently include future information (e.g., future churn status or data that would not be available at prediction time), the model could learn to make predictions based on this future data, leading to unrealistically high accuracy during training. However, when deployed, the model fails to generalize because it cannot access future data points as it did during training, resulting in poor performance.

    "To prevent data leakage when building a machine learning model, follow these key practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Proper Cross-Validation Techniques**: Always split your data into training and validation sets before any preprocessing. Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure that each fold maintains the temporal or logical order of your data to avoid leaking information across folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering Awareness**: Ensure that feature engineering steps such as scaling, encoding categorical variables, or deriving new features are applied separately to the training and validation datasets. These transformations should only be based on training data statistics to prevent information leakage from validation or test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Time Series Considerations**: For time-series data, simulate real-world scenarios by training the model using past data and evaluating its performance on future data. Avoid using future data or data from the validation set in any way during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Understand Data Sources and Collection**: Ensure a clear understanding of how data is collected and processed. Be cautious about including variables that could indirectly include information about the target variable or introduce biases that leak information.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Validation with Holdout Sets**: Use separate holdout sets (validation and test sets) that are not used in any way during model training. This ensures an unbiased evaluation of model performance on unseen data.\n",

    "You can use a confusion matrix to identify potential biases or limitations in your machine learning model by focusing on the following aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class Imbalance**: Check if the number of instances in each class (positive and negative) is balanced or skewed. A disproportionate number of instances in one class can lead to biased predictions. This imbalance is evident in the confusion matrix's distribution of predictions across the diagonal (correctly predicted) and off-diagonal (incorrectly predicted) cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Error Analysis**: Examine the distribution of false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN). Understanding which classes are frequently misclassified can highlight areas where the model struggles. For example, if FN (missed positive predictions) are disproportionately high for a specific class, it suggests the model might not generalize well for that class or lacks sufficient training data for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Precision and Recall Disparities**: Evaluate precision (TP / (TP + FP)) and recall (TP / (TP + FN)) metrics across different classes. Significant differences between these metrics across classes can indicate that the model performs well for some classes but poorly for others. This disparity might reflect biases in the training data or inadequacies in feature representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Impact of Misclassifications**: Consider the consequences of misclassifications (FP vs. FN) in real-world applications. For instance, in medical diagnostics, a false negative (missing a disease) might be more critical than a false positive (incorrectly diagnosing a disease).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Threshold Adjustment**: Adjusting the decision threshold for classification can reveal insights into how the model's bias shifts. By varying the threshold, you can observe changes in FP and FN rates and assess the model's robustness across different operating points.\n",
