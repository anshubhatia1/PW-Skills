    "#### Estimation Statistics:\n",
    "Estimation statistics involve using sample data to estimate population parameters. It provides methods for making inferences about a population based on a sample from that population. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Point Estimate:\n",
    "- **Definition:** A single value estimate of a population parameter. It gives us a specific value as the estimate.\n",
    "- **Example:** The sample mean (\\(\\bar{x}\\)) is a point estimate of the population mean (\\(\\mu\\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interval Estimate:\n",
    "- **Definition:** An interval or range of values within which the population parameter is expected to lie. It provides a range of plausible values for the parameter and includes a confidence level.\n",
    "- **Example:** A 95% confidence interval for the population mean could be \\((\\bar{x} - E, \\bar{x} + E)\\), where \\( E \\) is the margin of error.\n",

    "### Q3: What is Hypothesis Testing? Why is it Used? Importance of Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis Testing:\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions about population parameters based on sample data. It involves making an initial assumption (the null hypothesis), collecting sample data, and determining whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of an alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importance:\n",
    "- **Decision Making:** Helps in making data-driven decisions.\n",
    "- **Scientific Research:** Provides a method for testing theories and claims.\n",
    "- **Business:** Used in quality control, product testing, and marketing research.\n",

    "### Q7: Steps Involved in Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State the Hypotheses:**\n",
    "   - Null Hypothesis (\\(H_0\\))\n",
    "   - Alternative Hypothesis (\\(H_a\\))\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Choose the Significance Level (\\(\\alpha\\)):**\n",
    "   - Common choices are 0.05, 0.01, or 0.10.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Collect the Data:**\n",
    "   - Gather sample data relevant to the hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate the Test Statistic:**\n",
    "   - Depending on the test, calculate the test statistic (e.g., t-statistic, z-score).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Determine the P-Value or Critical Value:**\n",
    "   - Calculate the p-value or compare the test statistic to a critical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Make a Decision:**\n",
    "   - Reject \\(H_0\\) if the p-value is less than \\(\\alpha\\) or if the test statistic exceeds the critical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Draw a Conclusion:**\n",
    "   - Interpret the results in the context of the original hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8: Define P-Value and Explain Its Significance in Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### P-Value:\n",
    "- **Definition:** The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed, given that the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "- **Significance:**\n",
    "  - A small p-value (typically \\(\\leq 0.05\\)) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so you reject \\(H_0\\).\n",
    "  - A large p-value (\\(> 0.05\\)) indicates weak evidence against the null hypothesis, so you fail to reject \\(H_0\\).\n",
    "  - Helps quantify the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis."
