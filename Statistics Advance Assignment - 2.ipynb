    "### Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with an Example.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "- **Definition:** The PMF is a function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value. It maps each possible value of the discrete random variable to the probability of that value occurring.\n",
    "- **Formula:**\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  P(X = x) = f(x)\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  where \\( X \\) is a discrete random variable, \\( x \\) is a possible value of \\( X \\), and \\( f(x) \\) is the probability of \\( x \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:** Consider a fair six-sided die. The PMF of the die roll is:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  P(X = x) = \\begin{cases} \n",
    "  \\frac{1}{6} & \\text{if } x \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\\\\n",
    "  0 & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "  \\end{cases}\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "- **Definition:** The PDF is a function that describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a particular value. The value of the PDF at any given point can be thought of as the relative likelihood that the value of the random variable is near that point.\n",
    "- **Formula:**\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right)^2}\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  where \\( \\mu \\) is the mean, \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation, and \\( x \\) is the point at which the PDF is evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:** For a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 (standard normal distribution), the PDF is:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} x^2}\n",

    "### Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an Example. Why is CDF used?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cumulative Density Function (CDF):\n",
    "- **Definition:** The CDF of a random variable \\( X \\) is a function that gives the probability that \\( X \\) will take a value less than or equal to \\( x \\). It provides a cumulative sum of the probabilities up to a given point.\n",
    "- **Formula:**\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  F(x) = P(X \\leq x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} f(t) \\, dt\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  where \\( f(t) \\) is the PDF for continuous variables or the PMF for discrete variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:** For a standard normal distribution, the CDF is:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  F(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} t^2} \\, dt\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  This integral does not have a closed-form solution and is typically computed using numerical methods or looked up in statistical tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use of CDF:**\n",
    "  - The CDF is used to determine the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a specific value.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Examples:\n",
    "1. **Heights of people:** Human heights tend to follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "2. **IQ scores:** IQ scores are often modeled as a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.\n",
    "3. **Measurement errors:** Errors in measurements due to instrument precision often follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters and Shape:\n",
    "- **Mean (μ):** Determines the center of the distribution.\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation (σ):** Determines the spread or width of the distribution. A larger standard deviation means a wider distribution.\n",
    "- **Shape:** The normal distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped, centered around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4: Importance of Normal Distribution and Real-Life Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importance:\n",
    "- The normal distribution is crucial in statistics because many statistical tests and methods assume normality.\n",
    "- It often arises naturally due to the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sum of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables tends to follow a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution.\n",

    "1. **Heights of people**\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Binomial Distribution:**\n",
    "  - Multiple trials (\\( n \\))\n",
    "  - Each trial is a Bernoulli trial\n",
    "  - PMF: \\( P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \\), where \\( k \\) is the number of successes\n",

    "### Q6: Probability of a Randomly Selected Observation Greater than 60 from a Normal Distribution with Mean 50 and Standard Deviation 10\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the probability that a randomly selected observation \\( X \\) is greater than 60, we need to use the Z-score formula and look up the corresponding value in the standard normal distribution table.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Z-score Calculation:**\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{60 - 50}{10} = 1\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Standard Normal Distribution:**\n",
    "   Using the Z-table, the probability that \\( Z \\leq 1 \\) is approximately 0.8413. Therefore, the probability that \\( Z > 1 \\) is:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(Z > 1) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587\n",

    "### Q7: Explain Uniform Distribution with an Example\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uniform Distribution:\n",
    "- **Definition:** A distribution where all outcomes are equally likely within a certain range. For a continuous uniform distribution, the PDF is constant between the minimum \\( a \\) and maximum \\( b \\) values.\n",
    "- **PDF:**\n",

    "- **Formula:** If \\( X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n \\) are i.i.d. random variables with mean \\( \\mu \\) and variance \\( \\sigma^2 \\), then the sample mean \\( \\bar{X} \\) is approximately normally distributed for large \\( n \\):\n",
