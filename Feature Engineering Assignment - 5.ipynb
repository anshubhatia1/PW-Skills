    "Here are concise answers to your questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1. Difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding:**\n",
    "- **Ordinal Encoding:** Assigns integer values to categorical data based on the order or ranking of categories (e.g., Low, Medium, High mapped to 0, 1, 2).\n",
    "- **Label Encoding:** Assigns unique integers to each category without considering any order (e.g., Red, Green, Blue mapped to 0, 1, 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Use Ordinal Encoding when there is a clear order or hierarchy among categories (e.g., education levels). Use Label Encoding when categories are nominal and have no inherent order (e.g., colors).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:**\n",
    "- **Explanation:** Maps categories to ordinal numbers based on their relationship with the target variable's mean or frequency.\n",
    "- **Example:** Use it in classification tasks where ordinal encoding helps capture ordinal relationships in categorical variables while considering target variable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. Covariance Definition and Importance:**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Covariance measures how two variables change together. It indicates the direction of linear relationship between variables.\n",
    "- **Calculation:** \\( \\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y}) \\)\n",
    "- **Importance:** Helps understand relationships between variables; positive covariance means variables move together, negative means they move opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Label Encoding in Python:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample data\n",
    "data = {\n",
    "    'Color': ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'green'],\n",
    "    'Size': ['small', 'medium', 'large', 'small'],\n",
    "    'Material': ['wood', 'metal', 'plastic', 'metal']\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Apply label encoding to each column\n",
    "label_encoder = LabelEncoder()\n",
    "df['Color_encoded'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(df['Color'])\n",
    "df['Size_encoded'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(df['Size'])\n",
    "df['Material_encoded'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(df['Material'])\n",
    "\n",
    "print(df)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output Explanation:**\n",
    "Converts categorical values to numeric codes for each column using `LabelEncoder`.\n",

    "### Q6. Encoding Methods for Categorical Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gender (Male/Female):**\n",
    "   - **Encoding Method:** Binary encoding or Label encoding.\n",
    "   - **Reason:** Gender has only two categories and no ordinal relationship, making binary or label encoding appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Education Level (High School/Bachelor's/Master's/PhD):**\n",
    "   - **Encoding Method:** Ordinal encoding.\n",
    "   - **Reason:** Education level has a clear order (High School < Bachelor's < Master's < PhD), so ordinal encoding preserves this order.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Employment Status (Unemployed/Part-Time/Full-Time):**\n",
    "   - **Encoding Method:** One-hot encoding.\n",
    "   - **Reason:** Employment status has no inherent order, and using one-hot encoding avoids imposing any artificial ranking among categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. Calculation of Covariance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the variables:\n",
    "- Continuous variables: Temperature (T), Humidity (H)\n",
    "- Categorical variables: Weather Condition (W), Wind Direction (D)\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate covariance:\n",
    "- Covariance between Temperature (T) and Humidity (H) (assuming they are continuous).\n",
    "- Covariance between Weather Condition (W) and Wind Direction (D) (assuming they are categorical, ordinal or nominal).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- **Temperature (T) and Humidity (H):** Covariance indicates the direction of their linear relationship. Positive covariance suggests they tend to increase or decrease together, while negative covariance suggests an inverse relationship.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Weather Condition (W) and Wind Direction (D):** Covariance might not be directly applicable as these are categorical variables. If needed, you would look at association measures like Chi-square test for independence or Cramer's V for nominal variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating covariance involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y}) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) are variables, \\( \\bar{X} \\) and \\( \\bar{Y} \\) are their means, and \\( n \\) is the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This calculation helps quantify the relationship between variables, aiding in understanding their joint behavior in statistical analysis."
