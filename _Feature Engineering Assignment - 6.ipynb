    "Sure, let's address each question one by one:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1. Pearson Correlation Coefficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pearson correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship between two continuous variables. Here, you have data on the amount of time students spend studying and their final exam scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's denote:\n",
    "- \\( X \\): Amount of time spent studying.\n",
    "- \\( Y \\): Final exam scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you have collected paired data for 50 students, you can calculate Pearson correlation coefficient \\( r \\) using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ r = \\frac{\\sum (X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum (X_i - \\bar{X})^2 \\sum (Y_i - \\bar{Y})^2}} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( \\bar{X} \\) and \\( \\bar{Y} \\) are the means of \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "- \\( r = 1 \\): Perfect positive linear correlation (as time spent studying increases, exam scores increase).\n",
    "- \\( r = -1 \\): Perfect negative linear correlation (as time spent studying increases, exam scores decrease).\n",
    "- \\( r = 0 \\): No linear correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. Spearman's Rank Correlation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Spearman's rank correlation measures the monotonic relationship between two variables. Monotonic means that as one variable increases, the other either consistently increases or decreases (but not necessarily at a constant rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you have data on the amount of sleep individuals get and their overall job satisfaction level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's denote:\n",
    "- \\( X \\): Amount of sleep individuals get.\n",
    "- \\( Y \\): Job satisfaction level (ranked on a scale of 1 to 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate Spearman's rank correlation \\( \\rho \\):\n",
    "- Convert both variables \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) into ranks.\n",
    "- Use the formula for Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "- \\( \\rho = +1 \\): Perfect monotonic positive correlation.\n",
    "- \\( \\rho = -1 \\): Perfect monotonic negative correlation.\n",
    "- \\( \\rho = 0 \\): No monotonic correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. Comparing Pearson and Spearman Correlation:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the relationship between hours of exercise per week and BMI:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pearson correlation coefficient (r):** Measures the linear relationship between exercise hours and BMI.\n",
    "- **Spearman's rank correlation (\\( \\rho \\)):** Measures the monotonic relationship between exercise hours and BMI ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate both coefficients and compare:\n",
    "- If the relationship is linear, Pearson correlation will be more appropriate.\n",
    "- If the relationship is monotonic (but not necessarily linear), Spearman's correlation might be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. Pearson Correlation Coefficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the relationship between hours spent watching television per day and level of physical activity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's denote:\n",
    "- \\( X \\): Hours spent watching TV per day.\n",
    "- \\( Y \\): Level of physical activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient \\( r \\):\n",
    "- Use the formula for Pearson correlation coefficient as mentioned earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "- \\( r \\) close to -1 or +1 indicates a strong negative or positive linear relationship respectively.\n",
    "- \\( r \\) close to 0 indicates no linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
